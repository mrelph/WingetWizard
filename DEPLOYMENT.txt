                    UPGRADEBOT - DEPLOYMENT & INSTALLATION GUIDE
===============================================================================

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Windows 10 version 1809 or later / Windows 11
- .NET 6 Runtime (included in self-contained build)
- Internet connection for AI features and package updates
- Administrator privileges for package installations/uninstalls

QUICK DEPLOYMENT (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------
1. Build the application:
   dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained true -r win-x64

2. Copy these files to target machine:
   - UpgradeApp.exe (from bin\Release\net6.0-windows\win-x64\publish\)
   - config.json (with your API keys)

3. Place both files in the same directory (e.g., C:\Tools\UpgradeBot\)

4. Run UpgradeApp.exe

DETAILED INSTALLATION STEPS
---------------------------

STEP 1: BUILD THE APPLICATION
-----------------------------
From the project directory, run:
> dotnet build -c Release
> dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained true -r win-x64

This creates a self-contained executable (~100MB) with all dependencies.

STEP 2: PREPARE CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------
Ensure config.json contains your API keys:
{
  "AnthropicApiKey": "sk-ant-api03-...",
  "PerplexityApiKey": "pplx-..."
}

STEP 3: DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS
--------------------------

OPTION A: PORTABLE INSTALLATION
- Copy UpgradeApp.exe and config.json to any folder
- No installation required
- Run directly from any location

OPTION B: SYSTEM-WIDE INSTALLATION
- Create folder: C:\Program Files\UpgradeBot\
- Copy files to this location
- Create desktop shortcut to UpgradeApp.exe
- Add to Windows PATH (optional)

OPTION C: USER-SPECIFIC INSTALLATION
- Create folder: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\UpgradeBot\
- Copy files to this location
- No admin privileges required

STEP 4: FIRST RUN CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------
1. Launch UpgradeApp.exe
2. Go to Settings > AI Settings
3. Select preferred AI provider (Perplexity recommended)
4. Go to Settings > UI Mode
5. Choose Simple or Advanced mode
6. Test functionality with "Check Updates"

ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENT
---------------------

GROUP POLICY DEPLOYMENT:
1. Place executable on network share
2. Create GPO to copy files to local machines
3. Deploy config.json with enterprise API keys
4. Use startup scripts to create shortcuts

SILENT DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT:
@echo off
mkdir "C:\Program Files\UpgradeBot"
copy "\\server\share\UpgradeApp.exe" "C:\Program Files\UpgradeBot\"
copy "\\server\share\config.json" "C:\Program Files\UpgradeBot\"
echo Deployment complete

MSI INSTALLER (ADVANCED):
Use the included installer.wxs with WiX Toolset:
> candle installer.wxs
> light installer.wixobj

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
------------------------

API KEY SETUP:
- Anthropic Claude: https://console.anthropic.com/
- Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api

SETTINGS FILE (auto-generated):
settings.json stores user preferences:
- UI mode selection
- AI provider choice
- Window positions

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

COMMON ISSUES:
1. "API key not configured" - Check config.json exists and has valid keys
2. "Winget not found" - Install Windows Package Manager from Microsoft Store
3. "Access denied" - Run as administrator for system-wide package operations
4. "Network error" - Check internet connection and firewall settings

LOG FILES:
- Built-in logging panel shows real-time operations
- Enable verbose mode for detailed troubleshooting
- Export logs for support analysis

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
- API keys stored in plain text config.json
- Exclude config.json from version control
- Use environment-specific API keys
- Restrict file permissions on config.json
- Consider encrypted storage for production

UPDATES & MAINTENANCE
--------------------
- Replace UpgradeApp.exe with new version
- Preserve config.json and settings.json
- Test in development environment first
- Backup configuration before updates

UNINSTALLATION
--------------
1. Close UpgradeApp.exe
2. Delete installation folder
3. Remove shortcuts
4. Clean up settings.json (optional)

SUPPORT
-------
- Check built-in Help menu for user guide
- Review logs for error details
- Verify API key validity and quotas
- Test with simple operations first
